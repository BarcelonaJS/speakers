3. That's it. :)


## Time for your talk!

- Hands-free mics are available
- Please be at the event 5-10 minutes before start, to keep the organisers from freaking out

## After Your Talk

We're still working on automating this process, but for now please have a look into the [BarcelonaJS](https://github.com/BarcelonaJS/BarcelonaJS) main repository and find your talk in the 'talks' folder. Please edit the file on GitHub and add the url to your presentation and optional source code like this:

```
"workPerformed": {
   "type": "CreativeWork",
   "learningResourceType": "presentation",
   "url": "https://github.com/mhevery/angular-demo-slides"
 },
 "workFeatured": {
   "type": "CreativeWork",
   "learningResourceType": "source code",
   "id": "https://github.com/mhevery/angular-demo-slides"
 }
 ```

This is schema.org semantic information. Here's a [full example](https://github.com/BarcelonaJS/BarcelonaJS/edit/master/talks/20130506-angularjs.md).
